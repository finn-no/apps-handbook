# TRAINING

This section is work in progress, and we strive to learn from our experiences when onboarding team members
that are completely new to app development. So far we've only done this once, for the Android platform.

What we did:
- Java Intro
- Udacity Android Basics (https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)
- Kotlin Udacity courses (includes Room)
- Technical Challenge that we give experienced app developers for 2nd interview (For training, mention the libraries that might be relevant)
- Our standard onboarding task

Feedback:
- Git and GitHub (guidelines, flow, etc)
- RxJava
- Minimal app that uses flow
- Learn more about structure
- Introduction to agile, sprint planning, routines

- Have a solution project
- Have milestones or be clear on what we expect also when we finish a project
  - Discuss in the Android meeting
- What should I do during HackDay while in training program?
- List of Slack channels
- List of events or social things
- Abreviation guide
- Overview on areas (Ad In, Ad Out, Customer, etc)
