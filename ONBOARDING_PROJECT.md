# Onboarding project

Welcome to the FINN apps team. We have a project prepared for you to get used to some of the decisions we've taken as well to get feedback on them.

Some of the topics that you'll cover here are:
- Code style
- Architecture
- Folder naming and structure
- Networking
- Persistency
- Animations and transitions

The project consists in adding the Wishlist feature to the FINN app, you should be able to navigate to an ad in FINN and add it and remove it to your Wishlist. You should also be able to access all your wishlist entries from your "Min FINN" page.
Another requirement is that you should be able to access the items in your Wishlist offline.

Here we are attaching the design on how it should look. If you have any questions get in touch with your TDE.

We're thankful in having you and we can't wait to see all the things we'll do together.
