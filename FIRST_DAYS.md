# Welcome to FINN!

We are happy of having you with us, we have written this guide to get you started in your journey of improving your FINN app experience! If any of the steps are outdated or any information is missing please send a pull request.

It's your first day here and you should have temporary access card, remember to get your photo taken at the reception. I hope you have enjoyed unwrapping all those little boxes üéÅ. It's time for you to get all your accounts set up.

The first step to get you up and running is to setup Okta, so go ahead and open https://schibsted.okta.com and sign in. Okta is your main gateway for all the things Schibsted (and FINN), here you'll find direct links to all the apps you've access to. You will be asked to set up your account using 2-factor auth, to do this https://authy.com is the recommended system. The reason for this is that other 2-factor services don't have a backup system in place. **To set up Okta using Authy just follow the steps as if it was Google Authenticator.**

Once you're logged in you should see this:

## Practical info
- We usually eat lunch at 11:23 in the cantina of the 4th floor (on Fridays we eat in the 2nd floor just to be as close to the waffles as possible)
- The cantina expenses are withdrawn from your salary as a monthly expense (it's quite cheap), if you're a consultant this will be handled with your employer make sure to let them know
- Mondays is soup, Tuesdays vegetarian, Wednesday meat, Thrusday fish and Friday random (and waffles in the 2nd floor)
- Burger mondays are a thing here in the Apps team, so if you're carving burgers feel free to join or organize a trip to your favorite burger place, pretty sure someone will join
- Payday is the 25th of each month
- Make sure you're part of the upcoming "Ny i FINN" course, this will help you getting familiar with things
- For filing expenses you need to use Agresso (https://agresso.schibsted.no/agrprod/) with your FINN email
- Almost every Wednesday at 14:30 there is Academy (i.e tech talk) in the cantina of the 4th floor with refreshments

# Your first days here
Here's a rough plan of what you'll be doing, we hope you like what we have prepared for you.

## Training program
If you don't have much experience with Android or iOS we have prepared a nice 6-month training program for you, in this period you'll be mentored and challenged to become a great Android developer. This program might be different from people to people, it mainly depends on your current experience level.

## Onboarding program
If you have been working with Android or iOS for quite some time and feel confident you'll be faced with our onboarding program to get you started in how we have been doing things at FINN. We call this project "Wishlist" or "√ònskeliste" in Norwegian. You'll find all the details of this project [here](/ONBOARDING_PROJECT.md).

## Starter tasks
You will start contributing to our main app by solving tasks marked as "starter-tasks" in our Trello board, feel free to include any improvements that you have in mind into the mix, we'll collaborate to solve your doubts as well as to give you insight in any of the decisions we took in the apps. You're part of the team now, your feedback is important for us to improve the way we do things so please share anything that you feel could be better, doesn't matter if it's small or big.

## HackDay
Every last Monday of each month we have a HackDay, the goal for this day is to make something you're been craving to fix, improve or propose in the FINN apps. HackDay starts the previous Friday with a brainstorming sessions and starts on Monday as soon as you arrive to work. The following day we have a HackDay presentations meeting where you'll show your peers how awesome you are.

## Recurring team meetings
Every couple of weeks the Android and iOS teams gather to discuss ideas and to share their status, make sure you're invited to those.
