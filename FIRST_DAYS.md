# Welcome to FINN!

We are happy of having you with us, we have written this guide to get you started in your journey of improving your FINN app experience! If any of the steps are outdated or any information is missing please send a pull request.

It's your first day here and you should have temporary access card, remember to get your photo taken at the reception. I hope you have enjoyed unwrapping all those little boxes üéÅ. It's time for you to get all your accounts set up.

The first step to get you up and running is to setup Okta, so go ahead and open https://schibsted.okta.com and sign in. Okta is your main gateway for all the things Schibsted (and FINN), here you'll find direct links to all the apps you've access to. You will be asked to set up your account using 2-factor auth, to do this https://authy.com is the recommended system. The reason for this is that other 2-factor services don't have a backup system in place. **To set up Okta using Authy just follow the steps as if it was Google Authenticator.**

Once you're logged in you should see this:

## Jira
Previously we used Trello for issue tracking, but in late 2020 we switched to Jira to make it easier to collaborate with other teams (they are practically all on Jira, and we do a lot of collaborative work).
- [ ] Ensure that you can log in to the FINN Jira at https://finn-jira.atlassian.net/. Check with your manager if you can't log in.
- [ ] Ensure that you can see the app board at https://finn-jira.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=441, it should show you issues from the APPS project along with app-specific issues from ADOUT and ADIN.

## Practical info
- We usually eat lunch at 11:25 in the cantina (on Fridays we finish off with waffles and a coffee together!)
- The cantina expenses are withdrawn from your salary as a monthly expense (it's quite cheap), if you're a consultant this will be handled with your employer make sure to let them know
- Mondays is soup, Tuesdays vegetarian, Wednesday meat, Thursday fish and Friday random (and waffles in the 2nd floor)
- Burger mondays are a thing here in the Apps team, so if you're craving burgers feel free to join or organize a trip to your favorite burger place, pretty sure someone will join
- Payday is the 25th of each month
- Make sure you're part of the upcoming "Ny i FINN" course, this will help you getting familiar with things
- For filing expenses you need to use Agresso (https://agresso.schibsted.no/agrprod/) with your FINN email
- Almost every Wednesday at 14:30 there is Academy (i.e tech talk) in the cantina of the 4th floor with refreshments. You can see the schedule [here](https://confluence.schibsted.io/display/FC/FINN+Academy).

# Your first days here
Here's a rough plan of what you'll be doing, we hope you like what we have prepared for you.

## Training program
If you don't have much experience with Android or iOS we have prepared a nice 6-month training program for you, in this period you'll be mentored and challenged to become a great app developer. This program might be different from people to people, it mainly depends on your current experience level.

## Onboarding program
If you have been working with Android or iOS for quite some time and feel confident you'll be faced with our onboarding program to get you started in how we have been doing things at FINN. We call this project "Wishlist" or "√ònskeliste" in Norwegian. You'll find all the details of this project [here](/ONBOARDING_PROJECT.md).

## Starter tasks
You will start contributing to our main app by solving tasks marked as "starter-tasks" in our Jira board, feel free to include any improvements that you have in mind into the mix, we'll collaborate to solve your doubts as well as to give you insight in any of the decisions we took in the apps. You're part of the team now, your feedback is important for us to improve the way we do things so please share anything that you feel could be better, doesn't matter if it's small or big. If you can't find any suitable starter tasks, talk to your platform TDE and they are sure to find something for you to get your hands dirty.

## Competence Day
Every last Monday of each month we have a Competence Day, the goal for this day is to make something you're been craving to fix, improve or propose in the FINN apps - or just catch up on presentations and articles about interesting technologies in your field. Competence Day starts the previous Friday where you spend some time deciding what to do with your day, and starts on Monday as soon as you arrive to work. The following day we have a presentations meeting where you'll show your peers how awesome you are or what you've learnt.

## Recurring team meetings
Every couple of weeks the Android and iOS teams gather to discuss ideas and to share their status, make sure you're invited to those and talk to your platform TDE if you're not. *During the 2020-2021 Corona pandemic we're working from home, and we've increased the frequency to once a week.*
