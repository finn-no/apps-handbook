# Welcome to FINN!

We are happy of having you with us, we have written this guide to get you started in your journey of _making the FINN app great again_! If any of the steps are outdated or any information is missing please send a pull request.

Before your first day make sure to agree on an arrival time so there's someone there to welcome you. Make sure to bring your personal computer in case there's any issues with your new shiny hardware. 

On your first day walk into reception and get yourself a temporary access card, a picture will be taken as well. After this you'll be taken to greet the team (across the different spaces). After this you would come to Service desk to get your computer.

To set up your computer you have to know that [Okta](https://schibsted.okta.com) is your main gateway for all the things Schibsted (and FINN), here you'll find direct links to all the apps you've access to.

When setting up 2-factor auth https://authy.com is the recommended system for this. The reason for this is that Google Authenticator and similar don't have a backup system in place, if you need to set up a new device or lose your phone you are locked out from your accounts. And if you use SMS switching SIM cards can mean that you're locked out of your account as well.

To set up Authy just follow the steps as if it was Google Authenticator and scan the QR code using Authy.

## Practical info
- We usually eat lunch at 11:23 in the cantina of the 4th floor
- The cantina expenses are withdrawn from your salary as a monthly expense (it's quite cheap), if you're a consultant this will be handled with your employer make sure to let them know
- Mondays is soup, Tuesdays vegetarian, Wednesday meat, Thrusday fish and Friday random (and waffles in the 2nd floor)
- Burger mondays are a thing here in the Apps team, so if you're carving burgers feel free to join or organize a trip to your favorite burger place, pretty sure someone will join
- Payday is the 25th of each month
- Make sure you're part of the upcoming "Ny i FINN" course, this will help you getting familiar with things
- For filing expenses you need to use Agresso (https://agresso.schibsted.no/agrprod/) with your FINN email
- Almost every Wednesday at 14:30 there is Academy (i.e tech talk) in the cantina of the 4th floor with refreshments

# Your first days here
Here's a rough plan of what you'll be doing, we hope you like what we have prepared for you.

## Onboarding project
We have set up an onboarding project to get you started in how we have been doing things at FINN. We call this project "Wishlist" or "Ã˜nskeliste" in Norwegian. You'll find all the details of this project [here](/ONBOARDING_PROJECT.md).

## Starter tasks
You will start contributing to our main app by solving tasks marked as "starter-tasks" in our Trello board, feel free to include any improvements that you have in mind into the mix, we'll collaborate to solve your doubts as well as to give you insight in any of the decisions we took in the apps. You're part of the team now, your feedback is important for us to improve the way we do things so please share anything that you feel could be better, doesn't matter if it's small or big.

## HackDay
Every last Monday of each month we have a HackDay, the goal for this day is to make something you're been craving to fix, improve or propose in the FINN apps. HackDay starts the previous Friday with a brainstorming sessions and starts on Monday as soon as you arrive to work. The following day we have a HackDay presentations meeting where you'll show your peers how awesome you are.

## Recurring team meetings
Every week the Android team gathers to discuss a status, the iOS team does it every couple of weeks, make sure you're invited to those.
